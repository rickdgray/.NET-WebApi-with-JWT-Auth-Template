# JWT Auth in .NET 7 API Template

This repo is an example of how to set up a basic API with authorization and authentication using identities.

## Identity Entities

One of the key mistakes to make early on is to not inheret your application's `DbContext` from `IdentityDbContext`. It is a difficult change to make after your application is already established and when you inevitably need to implement identities, you are forced to either make a difficult database migration or, the more likely route, you simply set up a second `DbContext` specifically for identity. Avoiding this complication is as simple as inhereting from the `IdentityDbContext` from the beginning. There's no reason you cannot extend the user or role models either; you are free to add to them for things like user preferences.

## Disabling Cookie Auth

Another point of contention you may see around the web is the issue of trying to force webapi to use JWT tokens _exclusively_. It is surprisingly difficult to convince the server to not automatically attach cookies on the responses. You may find some [examples](https://wildermuth.com/2018/04/10/Using-JwtBearer-Authentication-in-an-API-only-ASP-NET-Core-Project/) [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/authentication-and-authorization-in-asp-net-5-with-jwt-and-swagger/) [and](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53970230/dont-use-cookies-in-token-based-authentication-asp-net-core) [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46323844/net-core-2-0-web-api-using-jwt-adding-identity-breaks-the-jwt-authentication) [and](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/8flq9r/net_core_why_does_identity_always_creates_cookies/) [everywhere](https://github.com/aspnet/Identity/issues/1376) that all mention one of three things: either use `.AddIdentity()` and just ignore the cookie, use `.AddIdentity()` and then subsequently delete the cookie on every request ðŸ˜’, or use `.AddIdentityCore()`. If you are like me, then accepting the existence of the entirely useless cookie is not an option. So then what's the problem with `AddIdentityCore()`? The problem with it is that the [SignInManager](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core/issues/578) is not properly added to the DI container by default and therefore is not available. Not only this, but the standard `PasswordSignInAsync()` method actually _relies_ on the cookie in the requests. So then what's the solution? 

Check out the source code for [`AddIdentity()`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/Core/src/IdentityServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L38), [`AddIdentityCore()`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/IdentityServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L33), and the relatively newer methods called [`AddRoles()`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/IdentityBuilder.cs#L185) and [`AddSignInManager()`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/Core/src/IdentityBuilderExtensions.cs#L62). If you compare, you will find that with `AddIdentityCore()`, `AddRoles()` and `AddSignInManager()`, there is complete parity, it is just not documented anywhere.

So, the solution is to use these three methods to set up all necessary dependencies for handling authentication. As a bonus FYI, if you want to send and confirm verification emails, you will also need to load in the `.AddDefaultTokenProviders()`.

```
builder.Services
    .AddIdentityCore<AppUser>()
    .AddRoles<AppRole>()
    .AddSignInManager<SignInManager<AppUser>>()
    .AddDefaultTokenProviders()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<AppDbContext>();
```

Oh, but there's one more catch! The `PasswordSignInAsync()` depends on the cookie, remember? The solution is to simply use `CheckPasswordSignInAsync()` instead. It does depend on fetching the user object before calling, but works all the same.

Now, __finally__, we have true JWT only authentication in our API.

## Email Confirmation
